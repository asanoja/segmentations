		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>
		In this paper we describe Block-o-Matic, a web page segmentation algorithm. It is based on an hybrid approach for scanned document segmentation and visual-based content segmentation. A web page is associated with three structures: the DOM tree, the content structure and the logical structure. The DOM tree represents the HTML elements of a page, the geometric structure organizes the content based on a category and its geometry and finally the logical structure is the result of mapping content structure on the basis of the human-perceptible meaning that conforms the blocks. The segmentation process is divided in three phases: analysis, understanding and reconstruction of a web page. An evaluation method is proposed in order to perform the evaluation of web page segmentations based on a ground truth of 400 pages classified into 16 categories. A set of metrics are presented based on geometric properties of blocks. Satisfactory results are reached when comparing to other algorithms following the same approach
		</p>
		<h2>Block-o-Matic Web Page Segmentation Model</h2>
		<p>We extend the concepts of [4], a model for segmenting digitized document in the optical character
			recognition domain, and adapt it to web pages. The content structure is the DOM interface after rendering
			a page in a browser. The geometric structure describes a page with respect to the geometric properties of
			content elements. The logical structure describes the connections of blocks at a layout level. For example
			if a logical block is found at top of page and the next in the bottom, that suggests a vertical layout flow.
			As shown in Figure 1, the segmentation process of a page (W) is divided into three phases: page analysis,
			page understanding and page reconstruction. The extraction of the geometric structure (Wgeom) from the
			content structure (Wcont) is called web page analysis (c2g function). Mapping the geometric structure
			(Wgeom) into a logical structure (Wlog) is called document understanding (g2l function). Rebuilding the
			web page from the logic (Wlog), geometric (Wgeo) and content structure (Wcont) is called web page
			reconstruction (Rec function) where, W= Rec(W cont , c2g(Wcont), g2l(c2g(Wcont))). The c2g function
			′
			constructs the geometric structure from the content structure. It organizes the content in function of the
			tag as: content, container, content-container or default elements. Additionally, it checks that there are not
			overlapping between siblings blocks. The g2l function constructs the logic structure from geometric
			structure. It assigns labels to geometrics blocks depending on their position in the web page, the relative
			area they occupy and the visual cues of their content elements. The labels are: left, right, top, bottom,
			middle or in other case standard. The Rec function builds the page (W') which is the original document
			(W) enriched with all structure, into an linear document in a XML-like style.<br>

<h2>Chrome Extension Installation Instruction</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download .crx file to your computer</li>
<li>Open a new Chrome browser window and write in the url bar <pre>chrome://extensions</pre></li>
<li>Drag &amp; Drop this files to this new window</li>
<li>Click 'Add'</li>
<li>Done. Happy BOM!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Stand-alone Installation Instruction</h2>
<ul>
	<li>After compiling and building the Jar file, the segmentation can be obtained using the following command:</li>
	<pre>java -jar jPagelyzer.jar -get segmentation -url <i>pageurl</i> -browser <i>abrowser</i></pre>
</ul>
<h2>Javascript Library Installation Instruction</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It is enough to insert the <i>bomlib.js</i> into the page to segment with a <i>script</i> tag. </li>
	<li>Ready to be used in conjunction with Selenium or just as is</li>
	<li>After page loading event, we can start the segmentation with the following function call:</li>
	<pre>startSegmentation(window,pAC,pS);</pre>
	<li>Where,
		<ul>
			<li><i>window</i>, in general is the current window object, but we can indicate to segment a page on an iFrame element or into another window, if it is desired</li>
			<li><i>pAC</i> represents the granularity. It is an real value between 0.0 and 1.0 </li>
			<li><i>pS</i> represents the maximum separation allowed between blocks. In general a value of 50px it is enough. For example suppose that we would like to have into the same block a paragraph with its title. A value of pS=10 will keep the apart, but pS=50 will keep them toghether</li>
			<li>The variable <i>page</i> hold the segmentation in the form of a tree of Logical Objects</li>
			<li>Calling the <i>getViXML()</i> will return a XML document with information of whole segmentation (see [<a href='#vidiff'>3</a>])</li>

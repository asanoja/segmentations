    <p>Algorithms for enumeration of simple cycles in graphs.</p>

    <b>Implementation Note:</b><p> All the implementations work correctly
    with loops but not with multiple duplicate edges.
    </p>
        <b>Performance Notes:</b>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst case time complexity of
        the algorithms for finding cycles in directed graphs is:
    <ol>
        <li>Tiernan - O(V.const^V)</li>
        <li>Tarjan - O(VEC)</li>
        <li>Johnson - O(((V+E)C)</li>
        <li>Szwarcfiter and Lauer - O(V+EC)</li>
    </ol>
    where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges and C is
    the number of the simple cycles in the graph.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst case performance is
        achieved for graphs with special structure, so on practical
        workloads an algorithm with higher worst case complexity may
        outperform an algorithm with lower worst case complexity. Note
        also that "administrative costs" of algorithms with better worst
        case performance are higher. Also higher is their memory cost
        (which is in all cases O(V+E)).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The package author's workloads
        contain typically several hundred nodes and from tens to several
        thousand simple cycles. On these workloads the algorithms score
        by performance (best to worst ) so :
    <ol>
        <li>Szwarcfiter and Lauer</li>
        <li>Tarjan</li>
        <li>Johnson</li>
        <li>Tiernan</li>
    </ol>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst case time complexity of the
    Paton's algorithm for finding a cycle base in undirected graphs 
    is O(V^3)
